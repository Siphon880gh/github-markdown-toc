Generates a clickable Table of Contents in your readme.md to be viewable by services such as Github.

1. Copy your repository's README.MD file into this folder.

2. Then run either command in the folder:

	Print to console:
	./generate-md-toc ./readme.md

	Append to same file:
	./generate-md-toc ./readme.md >> ./readme.md

3. If you had appended, open the readme.md and cut and paste the TOC at the bottom to a higher place in the MD file. Or if you had printed to console, copy and paste the TOC from the console to the readme.md. 

4. Finally, copy over the readme.md to your repository, replacing the old readme.md
